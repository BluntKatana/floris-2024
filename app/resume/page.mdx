## Resume

I am a positive, eager-to-learn and hard-working programmer. During the week I tend
to work a lot on a variety of projects ranging from data science and AI projects for university,
to full-stack engineering for my part-time job, and static site generation for freelance clients.
On the side I like to dabble into whatever I am currently interested in (which at the moment is
Evolutionary Computing) and try to not only understand the basics, but go beyond. When I am not
at my laptop one can find me at the swimming pool, on the running track, or on my bicycle.
Always training for the next sporting event.
