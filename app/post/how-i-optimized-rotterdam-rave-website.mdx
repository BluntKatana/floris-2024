A while ago I had the opportunity to work on the Rotterdam Rave website. In this post I will share my process and how I improved the performance of the website.

## How it started

Before working on the Rotterdam Rave website, I was a visitor of the festival.
When buying tickets I noticed how slow the website was. As a web-developer I could not let this go and decided to cold email Rotterdam
Rave to build a faster website for them (not thinking they would respond).

Just having learnt Next.js and web development in general, I was quite nervous to put my skills to the test.
But when the email came back with a positive response, I was excited to get started.

## The problem

The first thing I did was to ask for access to the website. I wanted to see how the website was built and what was causing the slow performance.
After getting access, I saw a few things that could be improved:

- I saw that the website was built using an outdated version of WordPress.
- They had a bunch of plugins installed to manage the images and other content on the website.

I could have optimized the website updating the WordPress version and removing the plugins, but I wanted to go a step further. Mostly because they gave
me the freedom to rebuild the website from scratch.

## The solution

I decided to build the website from scratch using Next.js. This would allow me to build a fast and optimized website. As Rotterdam Rave has multiple
festivals a year, they needed a way to easily manage the content on the website. I decided to build a custom CMS for them using Sanity.io (a new tool I wanted to learn).

Next.js allowed me to build a static website that would load fast and be optimized for search engines. I used Tailwind CSS to style the website and
deployed the website on Vercel for free.

## The result

After a few weeks of hard work, I was able to launch the new Rotterdam Rave website. The website was now loading in less than a
second and was fully optimized for search engines. Rotterdam Rave was happy with the result and I was happy to have helped them.
