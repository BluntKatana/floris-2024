I recently had the opportunity to work on the Rotterdam Rave website, and I wanted to share how my first freelance project went with you.

## How it started

Before I started working on the Rotterdam Rave website, I was a visitor of the festival. When buying tickets I noticed how slow the website was. As a web-developer
I could not let this go and decided to cold email Rotterdam Rave to build a faster website for them (not thinking they would respond).

Just having learnt Next.js, I was quite nervous to put my skills to the test. But when the email came back with a positive response, I was excited to get started.
